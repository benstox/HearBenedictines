================

Hear the Benedictines of Nursia and Le Barroux sing their daily Offices!

A silly script that can tell your browser to play mp3s from the websites of the Benedictine monasteries of
St Benedict in Norcia, Italy and St Mary Magdalene in Le Barroux, France. Both of these upload new recordings
daily of their Offices, Masses and sometimes other things.
